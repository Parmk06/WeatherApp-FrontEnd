# Weather Journal App Project

Welcome to my Weather Journal App project! This application is designed to provide real-time weather information based on user input, using OpenWeatherMap API and asynchronous web development techniques.

## Overview

In this project, I implemented an asynchronous web app that leverages Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. Key features and implementation details include:

- **ES6 Usage:** The code is written in ES6 to take advantage of modern JavaScript features and syntax.

- **Layout Modifications:** I made some modifications to the HTML and CSS files to enhance the simplicity and user experience of the application.

- **Error Handling:** An error message display has been incorporated to handle errors that may occur during API requests.

- **Temperature Units:** The application utilizes an extension on the API URL (`&units=metric`) to obtain temperature data in Celsius.

- **Code Readability:** Comments have been added throughout the code to improve readability and understanding.

## How to Use

1. Input the ZIP code of the desired city in the United States.

2. Optionally, you can include your feelings.

3. The application will display:
   - City name
   - Temperature in Celsius
   - Date
   - Weather description
   - Your provided feelings
